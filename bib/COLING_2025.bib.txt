    abstract = "Symbols such as numerical sequences, chemical formulas, and table delimiters exist widely, playing important roles in symbol-related tasks such as abstract reasoning, chemical property prediction, and tabular question-answering. Compared to tasks based on natural language expressions, large language models (LLMs) have limitations in understanding and reasoning on symbol-based representations, making it difficult for them to handle symbol-related problems. In this paper, we propose symbol-to-language (S2L), a method that converts symbol-based representations to language-based representations, providing valuable information for language models during reasoning. We found that, for both closed-source and open-source LLMs, the capability to solve symbol-related problems can be largely enhanced by incorporating such language-based representations. For example, by employing S2L for GPT-4, there can be substantial improvements of +21.9{\%} and +9.5{\%} accuracy for 1D-ARC and Dyck language tasks, respectively. There is also a consistent improvement in other six general symbol-related tasks such as table understanding and Tweet analysis. We release the GPT logs in https://github.com/THUNLP-MT/symbol2language."
