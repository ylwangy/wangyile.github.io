In this case, the molecular weight is relatively high due to the presence of multiple aromatic rings and nitrogen-containing groups.\n\n2.

The presence of nitrogen and oxygen atoms suggests the potential for hydrogen bonding and interaction with enzyme active sites.\n\n3. Bond types: The compound contains various bond types, including single bonds, double bonds, and aromatic bonds.
